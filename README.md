Place Server file at this exact path : C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Crab Game

The game gonna crash if you don't have all the files on Server folder.
If you already have the Server Folder, you can juste replace everything with this on, make sure to make a backup, then replace into Data, player.json.

If your game is not installed on C:\ and is not located to this address it wont gonna work.

Inject the .dll with CheatEngine
